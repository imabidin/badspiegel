<h2>1.&nbsp;Access data and hosting</h2>
<p>You may visit our website without revealing any personal information. With every visit on the website, the web server stores automatically only a so-called server log file which contains e.g. the name of the requested file, your IP address, the date and time of the request, the volume of data transferred and the requesting provider (access data), and documents the request. These access data are analysed exclusively for the purpose of ensuring the smooth operation of the website and improving our offer. This serves according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR the protection of our legitimate interests in the proper presentation of our offer that are overriding in the process of balancing of interests. All access data are deleted no later than seven days after the end of your visit on our website.</p>

<p>For the purpose of a shorter loading time, we use for some offers a so-called Content Delivery Network ("CDN") .

For this reason, access data will be processed on the servers of these service providers. We engage our service providers on the basis of processing on our behalf. Our service providers are located and/or use servers in countries outside the EU and the EEA. For these countries there is no adequacy decision by&nbsp;the European Commission.

<h3>6.2&nbsp;Use of Borlabs cookie for obtaining and managing consent</h3>
<p>We use the Borlabs Cookies plugin (hereafter "Borlabs") on our website to inform you about the cookies and other technologies we use on our website and to obtain, manage and document your consent, if required, to the processing of your personal data by these technologies. This is required under Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR to fulfil our legal obligation under Art. 7 (1) GDPR to be able to prove your consent to the processing of your personal data, to which we are subject. Borlabs is an offer by Borlabs GmbH, Hamburger Str. 11, 22083 Hamburg, Germany. When you visit our website, Borlabs' web server stores a so-called Borlabs cookie, which contains information about cookie duration and version, device and browser information as well as information about your consent behavior. No personal data are forwarded to Borlabs in this process. Your data will be deleted after one year unless you have explicitly consented to the further use of your data in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or we have reserved the right to use your data for other purposes that are permitted by law and about which we inform you in this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>6.3&nbsp;Information on third country transfer (data transfer to third countries)</h3>
<p>We use technology from service providers on our website whose headquarters and/or server locations may be in third countries outside the EU or EEA. If there is no EU Commission adequacy decision for this country, an adequate level of data protection must be ensured by means of other suitable guarantees.</p>
<p>Suitable guarantees in the form of contractually agreed standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or binding internal data protection rules (Binding Corporate Rules) are possible in principle, but require a prior review by the contracting parties as to whether an adequate level of protection can be guaranteed. According to the case law of the ECJ, it may be necessary to take additional protective measures for this purpose.</p>
<p>In principle, we have agreed the standard data protection clauses issued by the EU Commission with the technology providers we use who process personal data in a third country. Where possible, we also agree on additional safeguards to ensure that sufficient data protection is guaranteed in the third countries without an adequacy decision.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, it may happen that, despite all contractual and technical measures, the level of data protection in the third country does not correspond to that in the EU. For these cases, we ask you, if necessary, in the context of cookie consent, for your consent in accordance with Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR to the transfer of your personal data to a third country.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a risk that local authorities in the third country may not have sufficiently limited access rights to your personal data from a European data protection perspective, that we as the data exporter or you as the data subject may not be aware of this and/or that you may not have sufficient legal remedies to prevent and/or take action against such access.</p>
<p>In particular, the following countries are currently among the third countries without an adequacy decision by the EU Commission (example enumeration):</p>
<ul>
    <li>China</li>
    <li>Russia</li>
    <li>Taiwan</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out which third countries we transfer data to in the data protection notices for the respective tool and/or service we use for consent management/Consent Manager Platform (CMP).</p>
<h2>7.&nbsp;Use of cookies and other technologies</h2>
<p>We use the following cookies and other third-party technologies on our website. Unless otherwise specified for the individual technologies, this is done on the basis of your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. The data collected in this context will be deleted after the relevant purpose has been fulfilled and we have ended the use of the respective technology. You can withdraw your consent at any time with effect for the future. Further information on your withdrawal options can be found in the section &quot;cookies and further technologies&quot;. Further information, including the basis of our cooperation with the service providers can be found within the respective technologies.
