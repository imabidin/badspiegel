          <h2 class="mb-4">Shipping Costs by Country and Product Category</h2>
          <p>
            Our products—especially glass items and partially assembled furniture—often require 
            special handling due to their size, weight, or fragility. In some cases, packages 
            and pallets must be shipped individually (no stacking), which can result in higher 
            shipping costs.

            depending on quantity, size, and weight. Please contact us in advance at

      <!-- SHIPPING CONDITIONS -->

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
          <h2 class="mb-4">Shipping Conditions</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on size and weight, your order will be shipped via 
            <strong>DHL</strong> or <strong>freight forwarding (Spedition)</strong>. 
            You’ll receive a shipping confirmation by email as soon as your package 
            or pallet leaves our warehouse.
         </p>
  
          <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Shipping via DHL</h3>
          <p>
            Smaller and medium-sized parcels (up to 31.5 kg or a girth of 360 cm) 
            are shipped with DHL. Generally, delivery takes place Monday through Saturday 
            directly to your doorstep. However, very large parcels may not be eligible for 
            delivery to a Packstation or post office.
         </p>
  
          <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Shipping via Freight Forwarder (Spedition)</h3>
          <p>
            Items that exceed 31.5 kg or the maximum parcel dimensions are shipped via 
            freight forwarding. Delivery is “free curbside,” meaning the goods are delivered 
            to the sidewalk or property boundary. The freight company typically schedules the 
            delivery date via email or phone, offering a 4-hour time window (Mon–Fri, 8:00–16:00). 
            Saturday, Sunday, and public holiday deliveries are not possible.
         </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> If you cannot be at home during the scheduled delivery, 
            please let us know in advance. We can reschedule if possible. If delivery cannot 
            be completed within one week (storage period), the shipment will be returned to us. 
            In such cases, we will have to charge you for any additional shipping costs for the 
            next delivery attempt.
         </p>
  
          <h3 class="h5 mt-4">Transport Damage & Acceptance</h3>
          <p>
            Please inspect your items upon arrival for any visible damage. If you notice damage 
            to the packaging or the goods themselves, please note this clearly “with reservation” 
            on the delivery slip or refuse to accept the shipment if necessary. Then contact us 
            immediately so we can resolve the issue.

          <h2 class="mb-4">Delivery Times</h2>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise stated in the product description, delivery within Germany takes 
            <strong>3 business days</strong>, and international orders take up to 
            <strong>12 business days</strong> after order confirmation 
            (or after payment receipt for prepayment).
         </p>
          <p>
            Please note that no deliveries are made on Sundays or public holidays. 
            If a public holiday falls on a weekday (Mon–Fri), the delivery time may be extended 
            accordingly.
         </p>
          <p class="small">
            <strong>Right of Withdrawal:</strong> In the event of a withdrawal, 
            the reimbursement of outbound shipping costs is limited to standard shipping 
            (e.g., €9.99).
