          <h2 class="mb-3">Prepayment (Bank Transfer)</h2>
          <p>
            When choosing prepayment, you transfer the invoice amount to our bank account using 
            the order number as reference. You will receive our bank details in a separate 
            email after completing your purchase.
         </p>
          <p>
            Please note that items not in stock and requiring custom production will only enter 
            production after we have received your payment. The delivery time is calculated from 
            the date your payment is received.

            With <strong>PayPal</strong>, you can pay for your order quickly and securely. After 
            checkout, you’ll be redirected to PayPal. There, you can pay with your PayPal balance 
            or – even without a PayPal account – by invoice, direct debit, or credit card.

          <p>
            <strong>PayPal Invoice Purchase:</strong> For orders up to €1,500 (subject to a 
            credit check), new customers can also pay by invoice through PayPal. You will receive 
            your invoice from PayPal and have 30 days to complete the payment. Please note that 
            PayPal may request payment after the product has been shipped, even if you haven’t 
            received your item yet (e.g., due to longer production times for custom-made products).
         </p>
          <p>
            PayPal also offers <strong>Buyer Protection</strong> for additional security on 
            every transaction.
